## Description

The goal of this application is to use the inquirer package and node to generate a README file.

## Usage

This application can be used to generate a README file for the user. They will need to input the following input for their project: The title, description, how to install it, how to use it, how to contribue, how to test it, which license they want, thier email, and thier GitHub username.

## What I did

I built a program that uses the inquirer node package to prompt the user to input the information they need in order to build a README file for thier project.

## What I learned

I learned about how to access and use node packages, specifically Inquirer, and how to read the package documentation to use the package in my program.
